### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alex, a developer from Rennes (France). I'm mostly a python folk, but I also worked on the frontend with Elm and React.

Here are some projects I've been working on :

- [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican), a static site generator
- [Kinto](https://github.com/kinto/kinto), a generic JSON API for your applications
- [Copanier](https://github.com/almet/copanier), a software to help organize grouped-orders
- [I Hate Money](https://github.com/spiral-project/ihatemoney), a web application to help manage shared budgets (useful when sharing a house with others)

More recently, I'm working on [Chariotte](https://chariotte.fr), which aims to be a replacement for Copanier. I'm curious about LLMs and about security and privacy. You can read [my weblogs](https://blog.notmyidea.org) and my [Today, I learned](https://til.notmyidea.org) where I share my technical discoveries.
