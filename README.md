### Hi, I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹

Here are some software programs for which I have significantly contributed. You can also check out my [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/almet) pages to see other contributions.

[Pelican](http://getpelican.com)
: A static site generator that I [created in 2010](https://blog.notmyidea.org/pelican-a-simple-static-blog-generator-in-python.html). It's used by projects like the [Linux Kernel](https://www.kernel.org/pelican.html) and [Debian](https://bits.debian.org/pages/about.html). The one I'm most proud of :-)

[I Hate Money](http://ihatemoney.org)
: A website that manages group expenses, [created in late 2011](https://blog.notmyidea.org/how-are-you-handling-your-shared-expenses.html). It allows users to input who paid what, for whom, and manages a balance for you.

[Kinto](https://github.com/kinto/kinto)
: A generic backend for web applications. I initiated this project with colleagues [in 2012](https://blog.notmyidea.org/thoughts-about-a-form-generation-service-gis-enabled.html) while working for Mozilla. The project is currently in use managing the sync of certain data in Firefox.

[Copanier](https://github.com/spiral-project/copanier)
: A web application created in 2019 that organises purchasing groups. This software was first written by [Yohan Boniface](https://yohanboniface.me/) and I then took it over and adapted it for a group I'm involved in. I'm currently working on the next version of this with other folks in a project named [Chariotte](https://chariotte.fr)

## Past Experiences

[Brasserie du Vieux Singe](https://www.vieuxsinge.com/)
: I co-founded in 2017 an organic craft brewery that upholds values of cooperation, sharing, and gastronomy. I left in the summer of 2023 to return to development. The brewery still exists.

[Mozilla](https://mozilla.org)
: I worked from 2011 to 2016 for Mozilla within the "Services" team. I was able to work on projects around user data, encryption, and synchronization, as well as scaling some sites like addons.mozilla.com.

## Values and Interests

Free Software
: I have been working for and with free software for many years. It's both a pleasure and a given. I have encountered an open-mindedness and culture of openness I would hate to live without! I continue to maintain several software programs, mostly for fun.

Cooperation and Mediation
: I enjoy working in collaboration with others and figuring out how to make our interactions as healthy as possible. The quality of interactions interests me as much as the work itself.

Pragmatism
: Striving for perfection also means not getting too hung up on certain details. Sometimes, "perfection is the enemy of good."

Good Mood
: We only live once, let's have some fun :-) #yolo

## Technology

Python
: I use Python on a daily basis, it's my go-to language. I am familiar with its ecosystem, along with several frameworks (Django, Flask, and Pyramid).

Linux
: I use Linux as an operating system and for server management. I am particularly familiar with Arch Linux and Debian systems.

Frontend
: It's not my specialty, but I have enjoyed working with [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/), which brings serenity into front-end development thanks to strong typing.

System Administration
: I take care of running some services for third parties and myself.

## Education

- Master's degree in Software Engineering, University of Oxford Brookes.
